- Traceroute: returns all of the network hops that a request takes to get to it's destination
- nmap: Returns the status of each port on a given IP address. Careful this can take down
        your home network if you try to scan all ports
- dig: Returns the DNS records of a given domain name. Good for checking the status of an A record
        or CNAME record that you just setup.
