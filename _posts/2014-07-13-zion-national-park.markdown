For the long Fourth of July weekend I took a break from programming, and from Google to go to Zion National Park. I had never heard of the park before my roommate asked me if I wanted to go, but I'm always up for an adventure so I agreed. To get there we took a quick plane ride out of Stockton and into Vegas on our new favorite budget airline, Allegiance.
